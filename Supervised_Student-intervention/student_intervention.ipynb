    "I choose to test the following supervised learning models that are appropriate for this problem: Support Vector Machines, Ensemble Method with AdaBoost and Gaussian Naïve Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM:\n",
    "The Support Vector Machines models work well with not so large datasets, in a high dimensional space and when there is a clear marginal separation, but does not work so well when there is a lot of noise. They are also memory efficient and SVM are particularly fit for binary classification.\n",
    "Here we only have 300 training examples, but 30 features, and we are looking for a binary classification of our data, therefore this model seems a good candidate for the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "SVM are used for text categorization, for instance in Internet Search Engines to select web pages related to queries. Words in the vocabulary represent the features, which is a case of high-dimensional space in comparison to the dataset.\n",
    "(Reference: Joachims, T. (2002). Learning to Classify Text Using Support Vector Machines).\n",
    "Another use for SVM is image processing with handwritten digit identification. For instance, on the U.S. Postal Service data base that contains 9298 samples of digits obtained from real-life zip codes, with each digit represented by a 16 × 16 gray level matrix, the use of a specialized SVM gives results close to human performance.\n",
    "(DeCoste, D. and Scholkopf, B. ¨ (2002). Training invariant support).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Methods (Adaboost):\n",
    "Ensemble Methods, and Adaboost in particular, are computationally efficient, easy to set with no parameter to tune, and versatile with many possible base learners and any type of data. No prior knowledge is needed about the weak learner.  A weakness point is that they are susceptible to uniform noise. \n",
    "The weak learner selection is key, it can lead to overfitting if it is too complex, and need to perform consistently better than random guessing on the dataset, and boosting can fail given insufficient data.\n",
    "Adaboost has been designed to perform classification tasks, therefore this model seems a good candidate for our classification problem problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting using adaboost has been successfully used for text categorization as well. A practical use for text categorization is that of classifying news articles by topic based on their textual content. (Reference: Robert E. Schapire and Yoram Singer. BoosTexter: A boosting-based system for text categorization. Machine Learning, 39,135–168, 2000).\n",
    "In combination with different learner, boosting can be used for image recognition. For instance, an exotic use tested has been the classification of insects affecting stored-product, with Adaboost in combination with neural-networks.\n",
    "(Reference: Hongmei Zhang, Quangong Huo and Wei Ding. The application of AdaBoost-neural network in storedproduct insect classification, 2009).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes:\n",
    "A Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier is efficient for training, regarding the required computations. Only a small number of training data is required. In practice it has proved to performs well on many different tasks. However, because of the strong conditional independence assumption placed on the attributes in the model, there are situations where naive Bayes is not appropriate.\n",
    "This model seems a good candidate for the problem since we have a rather small dataset and we are looking for a binary classification of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naïve Bayes has been used for text categorization, in particular spam classification for emails.\n",
    "NASA’s AutoClass is a Naive Bayes based classification program, that has been for example used for classifying stars according to spectral characteristics or for discovery of classes of protein.\n"
